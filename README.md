# frontendproject

I created a simple function to satisfy the javascript requirement for this project.  When the submit button is clicked, the registration form at the bottom of the page toggles.  It isn't the most useful feature, but shows I can use Javascript to hide a div and reveal it.  Please note the "onclick" in the html file for the button.
